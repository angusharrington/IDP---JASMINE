# JASMINE Sensors Overview and Properties

NB - Work in Progress

11 Sensors are provided as follows, as ordered in the Tools and Parts List Rev 2.0:
* Infrared Line Sensor - IR diode mounted next to an IR phototransistor. Can be used to detect black and white surfaces and the distance to them.
* Short-range Distance Sensor
* Long-Range Distance Sensor
* Infrared Receiver
* Photo Interrupter
* Infrared Transmitter
* Infrared Emitter
* Light Dependent Resistor - resistor whose value is affected by ambient light instensity and wavelength.
* IR Phototransistor - BJT transistor which draws current into the collector proportionally to the ambient light level. The base current is provided by the light excitation.
* Hall Effect Sensor - magnetic field sensor via Hall effect.
* Ultrasonic Distance Sensor - ultrasonic ranging device.

Of these 11, it is proposed that the following are of use in tackling the problem statement:
* Infrared Line Sensor
* Short-range Distance Sensor
* Long-Range Distance Sensor
* Infrared Receiver
* Photo Interrupter
* Infrared Emitter
* Light Dependent Resistor - Not sure why a CdS version has been provided as it is not RoHS compliant and therefore has been illegal for use in industrial design throughout Europe since 2006. However, it is the only sensor provided that can respond to visable wavelengths of light, and so will have to be the basis for the colour detection electronics.
* IR Phototransistor - Functionally equivalent to LDR, allowing light sensing, but in the infrared wavelength only.
* ~~Hall Effect Sensor~~ - No real use to problem statement.
* Ultrasonic Distance Sensor - This is fairly inaccurate in comparison to the other distance sensors but could be useful.
