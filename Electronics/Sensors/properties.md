# JASMINE Sensors Overview and Properties

NB - Work in Progress

11 Sensors are provided as follows, as ordered in the Tools and Parts List Rev 2.0:
* Infrared Line Sensor - IR diode mounted next to an IR phototransistor. Can be used to detect black and white surfaces and the distance to them.
* Short-range Distance Sensor
* Long-Range Distance Sensor
* Infrared Receiver
* Photo Interrupter
* Infrared Transmitter
* Infrared Emitter
* Light Dependent Resistor - resistor whose value is affected by ambient light level.
* Phototransistor - BJT transistor which draws current into the collector proportionally to the ambient light level. The base current is provided by the light excitation.
* Hall Effect Sensor - magnetic field sensor via Hall effect.
* Ultrasonic Distance Sensor - ultrasonic ranging device.

Of these 11, it is proposed that the following are of use in tackling the problem statement:
* Infrared Line Sensor
* Short-range Distance Sensor
* Long-Range Distance Sensor
* Infrared Receiver
* Photo Interrupter
* Infrared Emitter
* ~~Light Dependent Resistor~~ - Not sure why this has been provided as it is not RoHS compliant and therefore illegal in post-2003 industrial design.
* Phototransistor - Functionally equivalent to LDR, allowing ambient light sen
* ~~Hall Effect Sensor~~ - No real use to problem statement.
* Ultrasonic Distance Sensor -
